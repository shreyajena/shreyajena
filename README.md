My time at CMU has been intense and transformative. I’ve built across machine learning, applied LLM systems, distributed backend workflows, and product strategy. Most importantly, I’ve learned how to put **[my heart in the work](https://www.cmu.edu/50/founder-stories/story-carnegie-and-mellon.html)**.

I’m excited about products that don’t just push the tech industry forward, but meaningfully improve operations and decision-making in non-tech industries. I’m especially drawn to product thinking — talking to customers, understanding **why** we’re building something, and ensuring engineering decisions are driven by real problems, not just technical possibility.

If you're building thoughtful systems or care about the “why” behind what we engineer, let’s connect.
